# Color System Consolidation Scratchpad

## How to Use This Scratchpad

This scratchpad should be used throughout the color system consolidation implementation to:

### 1. Daily Progress Tracking
- Create `color-migration-progress-YYYY-MM-DD.md` files
- Track completed tasks, blockers, and next steps
- Note time spent on each phase

### 2. Component Analysis
- Before migrating complex components (especially ModelAdvisor.tsx with 89 colors), create analysis files
- Document current color usage patterns
- Plan migration strategy for each component

### 3. Issue Troubleshooting
- Use `color-issues-log.md` to document any unexpected problems
- Include error messages, solutions tried, and final resolution
- Note any deviations from the original plan

### 4. Testing Results
- Document test failures and fixes in `testing-results.md`
- Save before/after screenshots for visual comparison
- Record accessibility audit results

### 5. Migration Patterns
- Save reusable code snippets in `migration-patterns.md`
- Document common replacement patterns found during implementation
- Note any edge cases or special handling needed

### 6. Technical Decisions
- Document any changes to the original plan
- Record reasoning behind color choices
- Note any compromises made during implementation

**Next Steps**: When starting implementation, create the specific files mentioned in the Color System Consolidation Plan and use them actively throughout the process.
