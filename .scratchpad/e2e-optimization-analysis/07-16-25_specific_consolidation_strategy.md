5. **`should work on mobile devices`** → Remove (covered by responsive CSS)

#### **CONSOLIDATE (2 → 1 test):**
- **`should display the main heading and hero content`**
- **`should display navigation with logo and menu items`**
→ **MERGE INTO:** `should display homepage with working navigation` (New consolidated test)

#### **KEEP (1 test):**
1. **`should display homepage with working navigation`** (New consolidated test)

---

### MODEL ADVISOR TESTS (11 → 3 tests)

#### **ELIMINATE (4 tests):**
1. **`should test AI recommendations with "write an email" prompt`** → Consolidate
2. **`should test AI recommendations with "create a Discord bot" prompt`** → Consolidate  
3. **`should test AI recommendations with "process large text data" prompt`** → Consolidate
4. **`should test AI recommendations with "hard Calc 3 math problem" prompt`** → Consolidate

#### **CONSOLIDATE (4 → 1 test):**
**All AI prompt tests** → **MERGE INTO:** `should test AI recommendations with multiple prompts` (Test 3 different prompts in sequence)

#### **KEEP (3 tests):**
1. **`should load the Model Advisor page correctly`** (Enhanced with model display)
2. **`should filter models by provider and test AI recommendations`** (Consolidated)
3. **`should handle API errors and clear functionality`** (Consolidated)

#### **MOVE TO UNIT TESTS (4 tests):**
1. **`should display model cards with correct information`** → Unit test
2. **`should test "Show More/Less Models" functionality`** → Unit test
3. **`should clear search results and return to model browser`** → Can be part of main test

---

### NAVIGATION TESTS (6 → 1 test)

#### **ELIMINATE (3 tests):**
1. **`should handle 404 pages correctly`** → Move to unit test
2. **`should maintain responsive navigation on mobile`** → Remove (covered by responsive CSS)
3. **`should maintain scroll position and smooth scrolling`** → Remove (not critical)

#### **CONSOLIDATE (3 → 1 test):**
- **`should navigate between all pages successfully`**
- **`should work with browser back/forward buttons`**
- **`should handle CTA button clicks correctly`**
→ **MERGE INTO:** `should navigate between pages and handle browser controls` (New consolidated test)

#### **KEEP (1 test):**
1. **`should navigate between pages and handle browser controls`** (New consolidated test)

## FINAL OPTIMIZED TEST SUITE (7 tests total)

### 1. **Article Sharing (2 tests)**
- `should complete full sharing workflow with navigation and accessibility`
- `should validate essential meta tags are present`

### 2. **Homepage (1 test)**  
- `should display homepage with working navigation`

### 3. **Model Advisor (3 tests)**
- `should load page and display model cards correctly`
- `should filter models and test AI recommendations`
- `should handle API errors and clear functionality`

### 4. **Navigation (1 test)**
- `should navigate between pages and handle browser controls`

---

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### 1. **Remove Heavy Operations:**
- Remove `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` except where absolutely necessary
- Reduce API mock delays from 1000ms to 200ms
- Remove unnecessary `waitForTimeout` calls
- Use more efficient selectors

### 2. **Optimize Test Structure:**
- Use `beforeEach` for common setup
- Reuse helper functions across tests
- Batch similar operations together
- Use parallel execution where possible

### 3. **Reduce Mobile Testing:**
- Remove mobile-specific tests (rely on responsive CSS)
- Test core functionality on desktop only
- Use mobile testing sparingly for critical flows

## UNIT TEST MIGRATION CANDIDATES

### High Priority (Move to Unit Tests):
1. **Meta tag generation logic** (from article-sharing)
2. **Content display verification** (from homepage)
3. **Model card rendering** (from model-advisor)
4. **API response handling** (from model-advisor)
5. **Error message display** (from all tests)

### Medium Priority:
1. **Form validation** (if any)
2. **Filter logic** (model advisor)
3. **Search functionality** (model advisor)
4. **Navigation state management**

## ESTIMATED RUNTIME BREAKDOWN

### Current Runtime: 12-18 minutes (37 tests)
- Article Sharing: 4-6 min (13 tests)
- Homepage: 2-3 min (7 tests) 
- Model Advisor: 5-7 min (11 tests)
- Navigation: 2-3 min (6 tests)

### Optimized Runtime: 2-3 minutes (7 tests)
- Article Sharing: 45-60 sec (2 tests)
- Homepage: 15-20 sec (1 test)
- Model Advisor: 60-90 sec (3 tests)
- Navigation: 15-20 sec (1 test)

### **Total Savings: 82-85% reduction**

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Immediate)
1. Remove mobile-specific duplicate tests
2. Consolidate content verification tests
3. Reduce API mock delays
4. Remove unnecessary wait operations

### Phase 2: Test Consolidation (Main effort)
1. Merge similar test scenarios
2. Create comprehensive consolidated tests
3. Optimize selectors and operations
4. Add proper error handling

### Phase 3: Unit Test Migration (Ongoing)
1. Move meta tag validation to unit tests
2. Move content display verification to unit tests
3. Move API response handling to unit tests
4. Add unit tests for business logic

## RISK MITIGATION

### Critical Flows to Preserve:
1. **Article sharing workflow** (blog → article → share → clipboard)
2. **Model advisor search** (query → results → filtering)
3. **Navigation between pages** (home → about → contact → model advisor)
4. **Error handling** (API failures, 404s, clipboard failures)

### Testing Coverage Strategy:
- **E2E:** User workflows and integration
- **Unit:** Business logic and component behavior
- **Integration:** API interactions and data flow

### Quality Assurance:
- Maintain test stability and reliability
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility testing
- Preserve accessibility testing for critical flows
- Monitor test flakiness and performance
