# Remaining Hardcoded Colors Found

## Phase 3 Status Update

**Issue**: Some hardcoded colors in ModelAdvisor.tsx were not fully migrated in my previous edits.

**Remaining Colors Found**:
1. `border-gray-200` - line 71
2. `border-blue-100` - line 78  
3. `border-t-blue-600` - line 78
4. `text-blue-600` - line 81
5. `text-gray-600` - line 104
6. `text-blue-600` - line 110

**Root Cause**: The MultiEdit approach missed some instances due to duplicate patterns or incomplete context matching.

**Solution**: Need to fix these remaining instances manually with specific edits.

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix remaining ModelAdvisor.tsx hardcoded colors
2. Run final validation
3. Complete Phase 3
