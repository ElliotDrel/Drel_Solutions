# Deep Analysis: Current State & Next Task Identification

## Current State Assessment

### Immediate Known Issues
1. **Article.test.tsx**: Numeric IDs (`id: 1, id: 2`) vs expected string IDs
2. **TypeScript Config**: Weak type checking disabled

### Questions to Answer Before Proceeding
1. Are there OTHER similar type inconsistencies across the test suite?
2. What happens if we enable strict TypeScript mode RIGHT NOW?
3. How many test files have manual mock data that could be problematic?
4. What's the current error baseline when strict checking is enabled?

## Analysis Plan

### Step 1: Comprehensive Type Inconsistency Scan
- Search all test files for numeric ID patterns
- Check for other potential type mismatches
- Identify all manual mock data creation

### Step 2: TypeScript Strict Mode Impact Assessment  
- Temporarily enable strict mode locally
- Catalog all resulting errors
- Understand the scope of required fixes

### Step 3: Test Infrastructure Audit
- Map all test files with mock data
- Identify patterns that need standardization
- Assess complexity of migration

### Step 4: Priority Decision Matrix
Based on findings, determine if we should:
- A) Fix immediate issues first, then infrastructure
- B) Build infrastructure first, then migrate
- C) Hybrid approach with parallel workstreams

## Key Decision Factors
- **Risk Level**: How many things break if we enable strict mode?
- **Complexity**: How much manual mock data exists?
- **Dependencies**: What order minimizes rework?
- **Value**: What provides immediate vs long-term benefit?
