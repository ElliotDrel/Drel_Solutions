original pdr:"""## Drell Solutions Client Portal — Complete Development Specification

### 1 Executive Summary

Build a secure, invite only portal where clients, employees, and administrators collaborate on projects, share files, track tasks, and communicate, while keeping internal content private. Development is planned for four phases that span twelve to sixteen weeks, with an estimated cost of thirty five thousand to fifty three thousand United States dollars. The stack uses React and TypeScript on the frontend, Supabase for authentication, database, storage, and edge functions, and Vercel for hosting.

| Employee | Upload a progress document to assigned project | Document appears in project list, admin sees it immediately, client sees it only if visibility is set to client or both |

A complete backlog is maintained in the project management board.

### 4 UX and UI Design

* Figma prototypes cover login, dashboard, task drawer, file viewer, settings, and admin panel.
* Tailwind CSS with a design system that follows Drell Solutions blue and gray brand colors and maintains WCAG AA contrast.
* Component library uses Headless UI for dialogs, menus, and comboboxes.
* Mobile first layout with breakpoints at six hundred forty, seven hundred sixty eight, and one thousand twenty four pixels.
* Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels provided for all interactive elements.

### 5 Data Model (Key Tables)

* **profiles**: id, email, first\_name, last\_name, role, secondary\_email, timestamps
* **projects**: id, name, description, status, client\_id, start\_date, estimated\_completion, created\_by, timestamps
* **project\_assignments**: project\_id, user\_id, role, assigned\_at
* **tasks**: id, project\_id, title, description, status, priority, due\_date, assigned\_to, created\_by, timestamps
* **files**: id, project\_id, filename, size, mime\_type, storage\_path, visibility, uploaded\_by, uploaded\_at
* **documents**: id, project\_id, title, content\_json, visibility, version, created\_by, timestamps
* **activities**: id, project\_id, user\_id, type, description, metadata\_json, created\_at
* **invitations**: id, email, role, token, expires\_at, used\_at, invited\_by, created\_at

Row level security policies ensure a user sees only profiles, projects, tasks, files, and documents connected to assignments or, in the case of an admin, the entire set.

## Layout Structure

A toggleable navigation panel sits on the left side of the screen and can collapse to icons only. At the top of the panel a Home button returns to the dashboard view. Below that a Projects section lists all folders and can expand or collapse to show their contents. At the bottom a Settings button opens user preferences.

The main area shows either a dashboard grid of project cards or a project detail view. On the dashboard each card represents a project with summary status information. In the project detail view the header displays the project name and the content panel shows tasks and files side by side.

## Core Components

* **Navigation Panel**

  * Home button
  * Expandable Projects list
  * Settings button

* **Dashboard Cards**

  * Project title
  * Task count indicator
  * Recent file activity indicator
  * Quick action icons (mark task complete, upload file)

* **Project Detail View**

  * Header with project name and optional role toggle for employees
  * Task list panel (clients can complete tasks and comment)
  * File list panel with upload control

* **Floating Action Button**

  * Context aware create new task or upload file

## Interaction Patterns

* Clicking Home resets the main area to the dashboard grid
* Expanding a project in the navigation panel switches to that project’s detail view
* Collapsing the navigation panel frees up more screen space for main content
* Clicking a dashboard card also opens the corresponding project detail view
* Quick action icons on cards let users complete tasks or upload files without leaving the dashboard
* In project view clients click tasks to mark them done or add comments
* Employees toggle between client view and internal view when needed

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

* Light neutral background for main canvas (off white or very light grey)
* White cards with subtle shadow and rounded corners (border radius 2xl)
* Accent color for primary actions (blue or teal)
* Secondary accents for status indicators (orange for pending tasks, green for completed)
* Navigation panel darker shade of neutral for contrast
* Icons in navigation and cards use consistent stroke style

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop considerations

* **Desktop**

  * Full sidebar always available by default
  * Split view panels in project detail

* **Tablet**

  * Sidebar collapsible by default
  * Panels stack vertically if space is constrained

* **Mobile**

  * Navigation as a slide-in drawer from the left
  * Dashboard cards in a single column
  * Project detail view as full screen panels with tab selectors between tasks and files

## Typography

* Sans serif font family (for example Inter or Roboto)
* Headings in larger sizes (xl for page titles, lg for section headings)
* Body text at comfortable reading size (base or 16px)
* Button and label text in medium weight for clarity

## Accessibility

* Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard focusable
* Provide ARIA labels for navigation buttons and icons
* Maintain contrast ratios at or above WCAG AA standards
* Include visible focus outlines on focused elements
* Support screen reader announcements for panel expansion and task completion

Brain dump:”””Help me articulate what I want to build. Organize my brain dump

Okay, so this is what I want to build into my Jell Solutions website. So, I want to add a login button on my site, and when users click, they'll be taken to the login page. And, obviously, they'll be able to sign in. Now, there won't be any sign-up option, meaning if they try to— if their information's wrong, it'll just say, reset password. If the email exists, if the email doesn't exist, then it'll say, no email found, please contact whatever. And then it'll be the link to the TalkGP page. And then, what'll happen is when— so, how the user will get access. I'm going to, on my end, have the ability to send the user—to type in a user's email, so there'll be a spot to be like, you know, create new user, right? And I will—it'll ask me for their email, right? And then it'll use my email sending service to send them an email with a sign-up link, right? That sign-up link will have a unique token, right? So that when they click sign-up, it'll take them to the sign-up page, which, because of the unique token, they're able to access. And they will then be able to—and then, you know, their email will be already filled in. And it'll ask them if they want to put a secondary email, and then to make a password. And next step will be, when they log in, what will they see? So, first of all, would just be their dashboard, right? And, right, keep in mind, so Drell Solutions is my website for my consulting practice, right? And this is basically what their—the client is logging into is basically going to be their, you know, like the portal, right, for the project, right? So on my end, I'm going to make a, you know, be like new client, right? And then I will upload all of my documents and files into there. So I will, you know, be like new client, right? And then it'll be like an empty dashboard, and it'll be just, you know, like what the project is. You know, I'll fill in the client info, stuff like that. And then I'll be able to upload documents, like meeting notes, stuff like that, which the client won't be able to see. The client won't be able to see the stuff that I send, that I, like, you know, push or make available to the client, which—and then there will be like a client view, right, which I'll be able to click and see what the client is seeing. And it will—so then it'll—I'll go into—so, you know, so the client, right, they log in. First thing they see is their dashboard, right, which would basically just, you know, show them that they are—show them, you know, like the name of the project, right? And that's it, just name of their project. And, you know, underneath will be like available files that they're able to view. Or, like, there'll be a task list, actually. There'll be, like, tasks to do, right? And they'll be able to click on each task, and it'll open up, like, on the right, like a sidebar, which will provide them more information on the task, if there is any, or just say, like, when I need it to be done by and so on. And then they will also be—and then they will have a option to—and then they'll be able to see files as well. And the files, when they click on it, it'll open up the file, right, on the page. And then on the left, it'll, you know, be, like, the menu bar. And then on the right, it'll be the—yeah, and then on the right, it'll be, like, the big space for the document. And then, you know, whatever document that is, it'll be shared with them. And, you know, this way I can, you know, have more flexibility with what I can share with them, right? On my end, I'll obviously be able to select, like, what editing status they have, right? That's, like, editing, viewing. I know that for this I will need to have document storage and an authentication system. Ideally, I'd like to use SupaBase for as much of this as possible, and then when SupaBase's bucket of storage runs out, I can move to AWS or some other free provider. The only other thing I can think of is... Obviously, there needs to be a settings page that the user can go in and, like, you know, reset password, you know, add extra email. Also, I will have the ability to work on my side, right? Keep in mind, this isn't going to be like an admin side or this isn't going to be like an employee side. Admin side is something else. Admin side is I can manage everything. That's employees and clients, right? My end specifically is going to be more managed. There's going to be an employee side, right, which is like, you know, has projects assigned to them by, you know, the admin. And they can only see the folders that they are assigned via the admin. But the admin can see everything of everything. And then there will also be a ability to work on these documents inside, right? So, you know, the employee can open up, can click, the admin can click, like, new document, right? And then a new document will be created. And then it literally just opens up a new doc, empty screen where they can start editing and working. It'll also autosave every, like, minute to 30 seconds.
