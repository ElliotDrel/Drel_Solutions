Model: GPT 4.1
Provider: OpenAI
Release: April 2025

GPT 4.1 is the current flagship multimodal model. It delivers top-tier reasoning, long-context retrieval, and strong coding ability while reducing cost compared with GPT 4o.

Key Capabilities:
- Processes up to one million tokens of context
- Handles text, images, audio, and video in the same call
- High scores on coding and academic benchmarks
- Advanced reasoning and problem-solving
- Superior multimodal processing capabilities
- Long-context retrieval and analysis

Technical Specifications:
- Context window: 1M tokens
- Knowledge cutoff: June 2024
- Response speed: Variable (higher latency than Mini versions)
- Cost: $2.00/1M input tokens, $8.00/1M output tokens

Best Use Cases:
- Very large document or code-base analysis
- High-fidelity research or legal assistants
- Multimodal tutoring systems
- Complex reasoning tasks requiring extensive context
- Advanced coding projects with large codebases
- Comprehensive document analysis and summarization

Limitations:
- Higher latency and cost than Mini and Nano versions
- May be overkill for simple tasks
- Requires significant compute resources
