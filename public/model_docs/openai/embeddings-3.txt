Key Capabilities:
- High-dimensional embeddings (3072 dimensions)
- Superior semantic understanding
- Multilingual support
- Efficient batch processing
- Strong performance on retrieval tasks
- Reduced hallucination in downstream tasks

Technical Specifications:
- Embedding dimensions: 3072 (configurable)
- Max input tokens: 8191
- Response speed: Very fast
- Cost: $0.13/1M tokens

Best Use Cases:
- Semantic search and retrieval systems
- Document similarity and clustering
- Recommendation engines
- Content classification
- Knowledge base construction
