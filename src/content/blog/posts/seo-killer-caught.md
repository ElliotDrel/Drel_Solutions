### SEO's Obituary \- The End of the Era of Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO stands for Search Engine optimization.

It is the practice of optimizing your website to appear in a search engine like [Google](https://www.google.com) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) results higher then your competitors.

SEO is decades old. For context, [content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid 1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#:~:text=Webmasters%20and%20content,%5B5%5D).

SEO is DEAD. Killed by AI search engines like [ChatGPT](https://www.openai.com/chatgpt), [Google Gemini AI Overviews](https://gemini.google.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), and Perplexity which NOW answer \[57.11%\]\[1\] of global queries directly.

According to [First Page Sage and Ahrefs](https://www.firstpagesage.com/), over 34.5% of these searches are Zero Click, meaning they DO NOT result in a user clicking on a website.

That is a GROUND BREAKING change. Just being the first result on Google is NO LONGER ENOUGH.

### The Autopsy Report \- What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization, or can be referred to as AI search.

It is the NEW playbook for OPTIMIZING your website to appear in AI generated answers.

The AI answer dominates the screen real estate, while the first two websites referenced as sources (shown on the right side) are NOT among the top 5 traditional Google search results below, demonstrating how AI search fundamentally changes which content gets visibility.](/blog/images/posts/seo-killer-caught/google-ai-overview.jpg)
*Screenshot form Google, July 2025, of a Google AI Overview of what the diffrence between a LLC and a Corperation*

Notice the FIRST answer the user sees isnt a link. It is a GIANT AI generated answer.

To add on, the first 2 webistes it references as sources, *shown on the right side of the answer block* are NOT even in the top 5 results on Google.

This is a FUNDAMENTAL shift in how users interact with search engines.

A July 2025 Similarweb study found that zero click searches on Google grew from 56% to 69% after the release of [AI Overviews Similarweb report on zero click growth after AI Overviews (July 2025\)](https://www.stanventures.com/news/similarweb-zero-click-search-surge-google-ai-overviews-3562/)

Visitor journeys are FRAGMENTING, clicks are EVAPORATING, and attention now lives inside the AI generated answer box.

At this point the question is HOW are you going to make sure your website is included in these AI generated answers?

### The Crime Scene \- Using EEAT to Optimize for AI Search

I am sure you have heard of EEAT before. EEAT has been around for a few years already.

EEAT is Google’s OFFICIAL guidelines on what it looks for when it recommends a website.

Meaning you should already be optimizing for this. However, I am sure you are wondering how much AI cares about EEAT.

Turns out A LOT\!

A May 2025 analysis showed that authoritative domains (.gov, .edu, and well-known brands) receive 73% of all citations inside Google AI Overviews, proving that strong EEAT signals dominate AI search results Empathy First Media, May 2025\.

That stat is loud. It confirms what content marketers have only guessed until now: if AI doesn’t trust you, you don’t exist. No matter how clean your website is or how high you rank in traditional SEO, AI search skips straight to the source it considers the most reliable.

That’s where EEAT comes in.

It stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. And it’s not just a checklist. It’s the AI’s internal compass.

Here’s what each letter represents, and exactly how it influences AI's selection process:

#### Experience: Connect with Your Audience on a Personal Level

**What:** Share your personal experiences and insights related to the topic.

**How:** This could include your own experiences, lessons learned, or unique perspectives that add value to your content.

**Why:** AI LOVES personal stories because it gives it something to present to the user that is not just numbers and facts.

**Secret Sauce:** I found that a personal experience, lesson you learned, or just a quick takeaway related to the topic works best.

#### Expertise: Prove You Are Really The Professional You Say You Are

**What:** Demonstrate your expertise in the subject matter. You have to prove to the AI that you are a subject matter expert.

**How:** Create in-depth, authoritative content that covers the topic comprehensively. Use data, case studies, and expert quotes to back up your claims.

**Why:** AI wants to use CORRECT and reliable information, so it prioritizes content that showcases expertise, as it is more likely to provide accurate and valuable information to users.

**Secret Sauce:** *Fake it till you make it.* Just because you are not the leading expert in your field RIGHT NOW does not mean you cannot write like one.

#### Authoritativeness: Establish Your Website's Authority In Your Field

**What:** The content should come from a source that is considered authoritative in the field.

**How:** Consistently produce high-quality content, earning backlinks from reputable sources, and engaging with your audience on as MANY platforms as possible.

**Why:** If AI finds references to you in a lot of other places (LinkedIn, social media, news articles, etc.) it will consider you an authority on the subject.

**Secret Sauce:** *It NEVER hurts to ask\!* You can request to be published on news sites, or even write guest posts on other blogs.

#### Trustworthiness: Build Trust with Your Audience

**What:** Your content needs to be reliable and trustworthy, providing accurate information.

**How:** Present multiple perspectives on complex topics. Address potential objections or limitations. Use clear, concise language and provide evidence to support your claims.

**Why:** AI tries to give the user a comprehensive and detailed answer, which includes both sides of an argument. If you only present one side, it will not be considered trustworthy.

**Secret Sauce:** The easiest way I found to present both sides of an argument is to use a simple table, or a pros and cons list.

### Wait, the Corpse Still Breathes \- What is Still Working in SEO?

Before you start digging SEO's grave, let me be CRYSTAL CLEAR about something important.

Traditional SEO is NOT completely dead. It's on life support, but it's still breathing.

According to [BrightEdge research](https://www.brightedge.com/), 80% of organic website traffic still comes from classic SEO tactics. That means 4 out of 5 visitors to your website are STILL finding you through traditional search results.

Here's what is STILL working and keeping SEO alive:

#### Technical Health \- The Foundation That Never Dies

Your website's **Core Web Vitals** are MORE important than ever. AI engines like Google still crawl your site, and if it's slow or broken, you're OUT of the game entirely.

- **Site speed** \- If your page takes longer than 3 seconds to load, you're DEAD in the water  
- **Mobile optimization** \- Over 60% of searches happen on mobile devices  
- **Clean URL structure** \- AI crawlers need to understand your site hierarchy

#### Topical Authority \- Becoming THE Go-To Expert

This is where traditional SEO and GEO START to overlap.

Building **topical authority** in your niche means creating comprehensive content that covers EVERY angle of your subject matter. AI engines are looking for the MOST authoritative source to cite, and that could be YOU.

#### E-E-A-T Signals \- Your Credibility Passport

Remember that E-E-A-T framework we just covered? It's NOT just for GEO \- it's been a ranking factor for traditional SEO for YEARS.

- **Author bios** with real credentials  
- **About pages** that prove you're a real business  
- **Contact information** that builds trust

#### The Bottom Line

Traditional SEO tactics are like the engine of a classic car \- they still RUN, but they're not going to win any races against the new electric models.

You CANNOT abandon SEO completely.

But if you compare what works for GEO (AI search) to what works for traditional SEO, you will see that a lot of the tactics are very similar.

So by focusing on optimizing your content for AI you will inadvertently be optimizing for traditional SEO as well.

- **Total global Google searches per year:** 5,000,000,000,000, published by Google and reported by Search Engine Land on 3 March 2025 ([Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/google-5-trillion-searches-per-year-452928)).  
    
  - This equals 14,000,000,000 searches per day (the article breaks the yearly figure down to the exact daily count).

    

  - **Share of Google queries that show an AI Overview:** precisely 57 percent, based on Advanced Web Ranking’s live dataset for 8,000 keywords, screenshot dated 23 June 2025, reported by Xponent21 on 15 June 2025 ([Xponent21](https://xponent21.com/insights/googles-ai-overviews-surpass-50-of-queries-doubling-since-august-2024/)).  
      
  - **Daily “Google-style” searches in ChatGPT:** exactly 37,500,000, the upper bound given by Similarweb and cited in The Washington Post on 8 July 2025 ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/08/ai-chatbots-google-search-myth-busting/)).


  **Step-by-step math (annualised for precision):**


  1. AI Overviews answer 0.57 × 5,000,000,000,000 \= 2,850,000,000,000 Google queries per year.  
  2. ChatGPT answers 37,500,000 × 365 \= 13,687,500,000 search-type queries per year.  
  3. Combined AI answers \= 2,850,000,000,000 \+ 13,687,500,000 \= 2,863,687,500,000.  
  4. Combined total queries \= 5,000,000,000,000 \+ 13,687,500,000 \= 5,013,687,500,000.  
  5. Share of queries answered directly by AI \= 2,863,687,500,000 ÷ 5,013,687,500,000 \= 0.5711487088, which rounds to **57.11 percent**.
